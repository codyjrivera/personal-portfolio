Distributed systems researchers have become increasingly interested in formal verification. At the same time, there has been much work on sound and often complete but undecidable techniques for automatic formal verification---called "natural proofs". We seek to automatically verify recently developed distributed protocols. In doing so, we are seeking protocol encodings that are amenable to natural proof techniques. We also hope to identify a logic fragment admitting complete reasoning that is sufficient to cover verification conditions for many realistic protocols.
