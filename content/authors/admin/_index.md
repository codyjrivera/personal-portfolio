Hi! I'm an incoming Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My current research interests broadly include programming languages, formal methods, compilers, and parallel and distributed computing.

Prior to joining UIUC, I did research in high-performance computing, where I worked primarily under [Dr. Dingwen Tao](https://www.dingwentao.com). I did this work as part of the [Randall Research Scholars Program](https://rrsp.ua.edu/), an honors interdisciplinary undergraduate research program at the University of Alabama. My research focus was parallel algorithm design and GPU performance engineering for scientific computing. Specific work I contributed to includes the lossy compressor cuSZ (part of the [SZ](https://szcompressor.org) compressor project) and high-performance linear algebra operations.

See my CV [here](uploads/RiveraCody_pubCV.pdf), and please don't hesitate to [reach out](#contact) to me.
