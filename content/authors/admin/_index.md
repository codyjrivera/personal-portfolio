Hi! I'm an incoming Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My current research interests broadly include programming languages, formal methods, compilers, and parallel and distributed computing.

Prior to joining UIUC, I did research in high-performance computing, where I worked primarily under [Dr. Dingwen Tao](https://www.dingwentao.com). I did this work as part of the [Randall Research Scholars Program](https://rrsp.ua.edu/), an honors interdisciplinary undergraduate research program at the University of Alabama. My work there focused on parallel algorithm design and GPU performance engineering for scientific computing applications, such as the lossy compressor cuSZ (part of the [SZ](https://szcompressor.org) compressor project) and high-performance linear algebra operations.

See my CV [here](uploads/RiveraCody_pubCV.pdf), and please don't hesitate to [reach out](#contact) to me.
